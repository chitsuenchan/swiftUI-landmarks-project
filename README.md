## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
An iOS app displaying a range of Landmarks with details and geographical information. Users can also favourite landmarks and filter a scrollable list of Landmarks to just their favourites.

## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This is a personal learning project aimed to teach me the tools and technology needed to build an iOS application. As later I would like to deploy an iOS application to the Apple app store.
